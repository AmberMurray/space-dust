Did you ever wonder what astronomical events might be occurring just above your head?  Were you ever worried that a piece of space rock might come speeding towards you and reduce you to nothing but... space dust?  

Worry no longer!  Space Dust is a fun, out-of-this-world web app which utilizes two of NASA's APIs.  One call brings back a very cool astronomical picture of the day.  Hovering over it will reveal awesome details making you look smart and interesting at cocktail parties.  Enter in other dates to see pictures from the past.  

On the left side of the screen, enter a data and the second API call is made to NASA's Near Earth Objects data. Parsed and packaged in a neat little table, find out how many rocks orbiting the Earth are considered close to impact (according to NASA's math).  Size comparison to a school bus helps drive home the importance of staying inside when the threat level is too high. ðŸšŒ  Enter other dates (birthdays, holidays) to see what lurks above.
